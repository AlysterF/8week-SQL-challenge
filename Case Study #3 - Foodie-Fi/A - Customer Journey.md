## A. Customer Journey ðŸ‘¥

To answer this question, I was based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, the challenge was to write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.

Customers that were in the sample: (1,2,11,13,15,16,18,19)

````sql
SELECT s.customer_id, p.plan_name, p.price, s.start_date
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions s
JOIN foodie_fi.plans p ON p.plan_id = s.plan_id
WHERE customer_id IN (1,2,11,13,15,16,18,19)
ORDER BY s.customer_id, s.start_date;
````
