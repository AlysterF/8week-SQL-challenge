<ol>
  <b><li>How would you calculate the rate of growth for Foodie-Fi?</li></b>
  <br>
  
  Metrics of growth for Foodie-Fi could work exploring customer and financial results.
  For customer growth, I would like too see (new_total - old_total)/old_total for churns and new signatures. 
  And for financial results, it would be great to see the total income and profit compared to last period analyzed, and also break those numbers through type of signature.
  <br>
  <b><li>What key metrics would you recommend Foodie-Fi management to track over time to assess performance of their overall business?</li></b>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>Revenue (total and per membership)</li>
    <li>Profit</li>
    <li>Gross Margin</li>
    <li>Retention Rate</li>
    <li>CAC</li>
    <li>Employee Satisfaction</li>
  </ul>
  
  <b><li>What are some key customer journeys or experiences that you would analyse further to improve customer retention?</li></b>
  
  I would focus on checking what is the most common path that lead a customer to churn, and try to understand (with surveys or somethings like that) why the customer decided that. Also, it would be great to check the most common path when customers do an upgrade, to try to reflect the good experience to the other ones that keep the basic plan.
  <br>
  
  <b><li>If the Foodie-Fi team were to create an exit survey shown to customers who wish to cancel their subscription, what questions would you include in the survey?</li></b>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>How often the customer used the service</li>
    <li>How long the customer was with Foodie-Fi</li>
    <li>Reason for leaving (unattractive contents, price, technical problems, found a better service, other[specify])</li>
    <li>Feedback (short text)</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <li>What business levers could the Foodie-Fi team use to reduce the customer churn rate? How would you validate the effectiveness of your ideas?</li></b>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>Engage the customers: Bring them to inside the company, show them the company value. We could measure it with sentiment analysis with data from social networks and determine a target percentage of positive sentiment regard our content.</li>
    <li>Solve problems presented by customers: Customers complain a lot when a service/product is awful. So let's hear them and reduce the number of complains to the minimum possible.</li>
    <li>Give attention to the most valuable customers: the loyal customers should feel they're special. Let's represent them. We can measure effectiveness considering positive sentiment and maybe implement a indication program, and measure how that number grows.</li>
    <li>Have a retention plan to those who are leaving. If we offer something different in price os content, would they stay? (test with some and measure the number os retentions)</li>
  </ul>
</ol>
