## Business Case

Danny wants to use the data to answer some questions about his customers and have some insights to improve his connection with his customers. He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalt program.
It was provided a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues, but it should be enough to create fully functioning SQL queries. The data is organized in three entities and you can check more about it the entity diagram below.
