**Query #01**

````sql

**Query #02**

What was the most commonly added extra?

````sql

**Query #03**

What was the most common exclusion?

````sql

**Query #04**

Generate an order item for each record in the customers_orders table in the format of one of the following:

    Meat Lovers
    Meat Lovers - Exclude Beef
    Meat Lovers - Extra Bacon
    Meat Lovers - Exclude Cheese, Bacon - Extra Mushroom, Peppers

This was one of the hardest queries I had to write. I'm not sure if the currenct query is in its higher efficiency, but I was just glad I was able to get the answer!
I'm really open to comments, ok? Feel free to send me a message to comment your opinion about this query.

**Query #05**

Generate an alphabetically ordered comma separated ingredient list for each pizza order from the customer_orders table and add a 2x in front of any relevant ingredients

    For example: "Meat Lovers: 2xBacon, Beef, ... , Salami"

This one was easier than the last one, specially because I didn't have to show which ingredient was excluded, I just deleted them from the list of ingredients.

````sql

      SELECT
        co.id,

        pt.topping_name,
        CASE
          WHEN pt.topping_id IN (SELECT extra_id FROM extras WHERE id = co.id) THEN '2x'
          ELSE NULL
        END AS double_option
      FROM
        cust_orders co
      JOIN
        pizza_ingredients pi ON pi.pizza_id = co.pizza_id
      JOIN
        pizza_runner.pizza_names pn ON pn.pizza_id = pi.pizza_id
