The 8 week SQL challenge is a free challenge created by Danny Ma from [Data with Danny](https://www.datawithdanny.com/).
It has 8 funny case studies waiting for awesome SQL query solutions!
If you want to know more about the challenge and Danny Ma (and I really recommend you do), feel free to access the [8 Week SQL Challenge Page](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/).

  <summary> <b> Case #1 details </b> </summary>

  #### Business Case

  Danny wants to use the data to answer some questions about his customers and have some insights to improve his connection with his customers. He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalt program.
  It was provided a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues, but it should be enough to create fully functioning SQL queries. The data is organized in three entities and you can check more about it the entity diagram below.

  <summary> <b> Case questions </b> </summary>
  <br>
    <ol>
      <li>What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?</li>
      <li>How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?</li>
      <li>What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?</li>
      <li>What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?</li>
      <li>Which item was the most popular for each customer?</li>
      <li>Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?</li>
      <li>Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?</li>
      <li>What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?</li>
      <li>If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?</li>
      <li>In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?</li>
